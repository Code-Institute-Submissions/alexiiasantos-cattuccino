Cattuccino is a cat cafe situated in Dublin. This project was created for people who love cats and coffee. They will have access to a menu, with a variety of food, meet the cats and find more about them and have information about the cafe. This is a fictional website. 
The website can be improved in the future with merchandise and even order takeway.

This project aims to show my new acquired skills in design and create a static web page using HTML and CSS.


# Features

  • Header navigation - Presented in all four pages includes the links to Home, Menu, Meet the Cats and Contacts. It allows the user to navigate easily between them without having to revert back to the previous pages.
  
  • **Home page** - Includes a brief presentation of the establishment, followed by rules and a gallery.
  
  • **Menu page** - Includes a variety of foods and different prices. Includes breakfast, a vegan section, salads, cakes, cold drinks and coffee.
  
  • **Meet the Cats** - This page has the purpose to introduce the cats to the user. The user will be able to meet four different cats: Mitzi, Luna, Naruto and Jiraya. All of them have their breed and age shown, and also can read about their hobbies and favourite treats.
  
  • **Contacts** - Includes the address of the cafe, opening hours, phone number and a form where the customers can write their feedback.
  
  • **Footer** - The footer has social links to help expand the cafe brand through social media. Each button will open in a new window.
  
  # Features left to implement
  
  • **Takeaway order** - This feature would be fantastic in the website, the customers would be able to order drinks and food online having the option to choose delivery or colection.
  
  # Testing
  
  I have used Google Chrome dev tools to see how the website would load with different sizes. I have also tested in a Ipad mini and Iphone 12 Pro. All images and icons performed as anticipated.
  
  • **Desktop** - Tested on Google Chrome and Firefox browser: All pages, links and icons worked as anticipated, changing between large, medium and small screens.
  
  • **Mobile** - Tested on my Iphone12 Pro
